# Transfer Learning Chatbot using Pretrained LLM
This project builds a chatbot that can interact with individuals and provide support. It uses a transfer learning approach, leveraging a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM), such as GPT, to fine-tune the model for specific tasks, allowing the chatbot to provide conversational support in various domains.

# Features
Conversational AI: The chatbot can engage in meaningful dialogues with users.
Support System: The chatbot is designed to assist users in various support domains, such as technical issues, general queries, etc.
Transfer Learning: Fine-tuning a pretrained LLM (e.g., GPT-3 or GPT-4) to enhance its performance for specific use cases.
Contextual Awareness: The model can maintain context across multiple turns in the conversation.
